# Embedded-Systems-Development-Project-PBL
Designing and implementing embedded applications using C for ATMega328p and ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. Integrating key peripherals including GPIO, timers, ADC/DAC, UART, I2C, SPI, RTC, and DMA. Bare-metal and RTOS-based systems, applying real-time scheduling and interrupt-driven control.

# Unit 1 - Introduction to 8-bit microcontrollers and basic peripherals
This project focused on the fundamentals of embedded systems, emphasizing both theoretical understanding and practical application. It began with a comprehensive review of the C programming language tailored for embedded environments, followed by an introduction to the ATmega328p microcontroller and its architecture. Throughout the project, I worked extensively with essential peripherals such as GPIO, interrupts, ADC, timers, USART, and EEPROM, gaining hands-on experience in configuring and integrating these components. Development was carried out using the Microchip StudioÂ® IDE, which provided a robust platform for coding, debugging, and testing. As part of the curriculum, I completed a partial integrative project that consolidated the acquired knowledge into a functional embedded system prototype, demonstrating proficiency in low-level programming and hardware interfacing.

## SIMULIDE
> [SimulIDE](https://simulide.com/p) is a simple real time electronic circuit simulator, intended for hobbyist or students to learn and experiment with analog and digital electronic circuits and microcontrollers. It supports PIC, AVR , Arduino and other MCUs and MPUs. 

## PICSimLab
> [PICSimLab](https://github.com/lcgamboa/picsimlab) is a realtime emulator of [development boards](https://lcgamboa.github.io/picsimlab_docs/stable/Boards.html) with MPLABX/avr-gdb debugger integration.


## Sprints

This macro project will be subdivided into approximately 10 sprints. A new CPU component will be implemented in each sprint.
